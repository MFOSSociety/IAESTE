# IAESTE-Bangladesh


## Problem Statement

To achieve Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, we need to create employment opportunities along with making policy to promote our own culture and products through sustainable tourism. We have to overcome a numerous challenges to fulfil the target. To face the challenges of tourism, it is essential to take a national master plan. We don't have that master plan. We are not familiar with "Community Tourism" in our country. There is no coordination between the travel agencies and tour operators. Here in Bangladesh, lack of security for the tourist is the biggest problem. We don't even have enough information regarding our tourism. There is a very limited source to know about the tourist spots. We don't even know how many tourist spots are here, let alone the foreign tourists. People, who are associated with the tourism industry don't have efficiency in English language. Event calendar doesn't exist here. That's why we just don't have any idea about what kind of program is going to be held throughout the year. Effective initiative hasn't taken yet to promote the tourism based product. If we can overcome all these problems, our tourism goals will be achieved by the year 2030.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Many women in Myanmar practice birth spacing using contraceptive injections. However, these injections only last for 8-12 weeks.
Many women forget to get their injection regularly or, if money is tight, they choose to delay it. This massively reduces the effectiveness of the contraception increasing the likelihood that they will have an unplanned pregnancy.
A related problem is that if the woman does not plan to have children for a while there are better birth spacing alternatives that they could use. However, many women donâ€™t know about these alternatives or when they are useful. How could you develop a system to ensure that women are reminded of when they are due for another injection? Also how could use that system to educate women of the alternatives that are available to them?

If we can provide innovative reminder to the women using 3 months injection, we can reduce the number of unwanted pregnancy and as the result, we can also reduce the number of death by unsafe abortion.

# IAESTE-JAPAN

## Problem statement 1
Japan is a country that is prone to various natural disasters; not only earthquakes and tsunami, but also volcanoes, typhoons, floods and mudslides. Therefore, IAESTE Japan is diligently working to build a nation that is more prepared for disasters, by resolutely reviewing disaster risk reduction measures and constantly incorporating the latest scientific knowledge on disasters, never forgetting the invaluable lessons learned from the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami.


**IAESTE Japan** would request you to contribute further to global disaster risk reduction by providing an SOS system that would send an alert to nearby emergency response team for immediate relief.

# IAESTE-SPAIN

## Problem statement 
One of the current issue for our farmers to gain maximum from the produce they are producing by an efficient supply chain platform with correct forecast.

### Ask 
Create a platform (preferably a lightweight mobile platform) which will help users (farmers) to post minimum bidding produce price (MSP) for retailers/end consumers to know and bid for buying. It will be good if logistic module (like carriers who can help in transportng produce from farm location to sale location) embed in the design.


### Things to be in mind:
1. Forecast correct price
2. Forecast correct demand (region wise)
3. Preferable buyers
4. Buying patterns
